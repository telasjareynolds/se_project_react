# Project React: WTWR
This project was developed during Sprint 11 at TripleTen, focusing on building a dynamic, responsive web app with React. This weather-based app provides a dynamic user experience by fetching local weather data and allowing users to switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius with a simple toggle. Users can personalize their experience further by adding or removing clothing items, displayed as interactive cards. Each clothing card represents a unique item suited to the weather conditions, helping users decide what to wear based on real-time data.
